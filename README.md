🎵 Musical Styles Website

This project was developed as part of an academic activity for the Information Systems course.
It was created in collaboration with Eduardo Urbano, under the guidance of Professor Jean Santos.

📚 Project Overview

The goal was to build a simple website about musical styles, using only HTML and JavaScript, without CSS.
The project aimed to practice fundamental web development concepts such as page structure, DOM manipulation, and logical organization of code.

Additionally, the project had specific requirements:

Maximum of 6 pages

Use of a predefined color palette with the following hex values:

#FFCCCC, #FFCC99, #FFFFCC, #CCFFCC, #99FFCC, #CCFFFF, #99CCFF, #CCCCFF, #FFCCFF

💡 What We Learned

Through this activity, we learned how to:

Plan the structure of a multi-page website

Manipulate elements dynamically using JavaScript

Create interaction and logic even without visual styling

Collaborate effectively in a small development team

This was one of my first web projects, marking the beginning of my journey into web development and programming in general.
